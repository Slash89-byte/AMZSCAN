## ü§î **Key Implementation Questions**

### **1. Architecture & Approach**

#### **Q1.1: Method Structure**
- **Option A**: Enhance existing `calculate_total_fees()` method with optional parameters
- **Option B**: Create new `calculate_comprehensive_fees()` method alongside existing ones
- **Option C**: Replace current method entirely with comprehensive version

**Which approach do you prefer for maintaining compatibility?**

#### **Q1.2: Backward Compatibility**
- Should the current simple fee calculation remain as the default?
- Do existing integrations (GUI, ROI calculator) need to work unchanged?
- Should we provide both "simple" and "comprehensive" modes?

---

### **2. Storage Fees**

#### **Q2.1: Storage Duration**
- **Default Storage Time**: How many months should we assume as default? (1, 2, 3 months?)
- **Seasonal Variation**: Should we account for peak season (Oct-Dec) higher rates automatically?
- **User Input**: Should storage time be configurable per product or use a global default?

#### **Q2.2: Product Dimensions**
- **Volume Calculation**: How do we estimate product volume? Use weight-to-volume ratio?
- **Size Classification**: How do we determine "standard" vs "oversize" products?
- **Default Values**: What volume should we assume if not specified?

#### **Q2.3: Storage Rates (France)**
```
Current Amazon France Storage Fees:
- Standard Size: ‚Ç¨26/m¬≥ (Jan-Sep), ‚Ç¨36/m¬≥ (Oct-Dec)
- Oversize: ‚Ç¨18.60/m¬≥ (year-round)
```
**Are these rates accurate for your calculations?**

---

### **3. Prep Fees**

#### **Q3.1: Service Selection**
- **Default Prep Services**: Which prep services should be included by default?
  - Labeling (‚Ç¨0.20/item)
  - Bubble wrap (‚Ç¨1.00/item)
  - Bagging (‚Ç¨0.55/item)
  - Taping (‚Ç¨0.70/item)
  - Other?

#### **Q3.2: Prep Strategy**
- **Per Product**: Should prep fees be configurable per product type/category?
- **Percentage Approach**: Or calculate as percentage of products requiring prep?
- **User Control**: Should users be able to toggle prep services on/off?

---

### **4. Inbound Shipping**

#### **Q4.1: Shipping Method**
- **Small Parcel**: ‚Ç¨8.50 per shipment (up to 30kg)
- **LTL/Pallet**: ‚Ç¨150+ for larger shipments
- **Per-Unit Basis**: ‚Ç¨0.15/kg weight-based calculation

**Which method do you typically use? Should this be user-configurable?**

#### **Q4.2: Shipping Frequency**
- **Per Product**: Calculate shipping cost per individual product?
- **Batch Shipping**: Distribute shipping cost across multiple products?
- **Default Allocation**: What's a reasonable default shipping cost per item?

---

### **5. Digital Services Fees**

#### **Q5.1: Advertising Costs**
- **Ad Spend Integration**: Should we include Amazon PPC advertising costs?
- **Percentage Model**: Calculate as percentage of sales (typically 10-30% of revenue)?
- **Optional Feature**: Should advertising costs be optional/configurable?

#### **Q5.2: Other Digital Services**
- **Brand Registry**: Typically free, but any associated costs?
- **A+ Content**: Free for brand owners, paid for others?
- **Enhanced Brand Content**: Any costs to consider?

---

### **6. Miscellaneous Fees**

#### **Q6.1: Return Processing**
- **Return Rate**: What percentage of products typically get returned? (5%, 10%, 15%?)
- **Return Fee**: ‚Ç¨2.30 per returned item - should this be calculated automatically?
- **Category Variation**: Do return rates vary by product category?

#### **Q6.2: Other Misc Fees**
```
Potential Misc Fees:
- High Volume Listing: ‚Ç¨0.05/listing
- Media Listing: ‚Ç¨0.05/item  
- Disposal Fee: ‚Ç¨0.15/unit
- Removal Fee: ‚Ç¨0.50/unit
```
**Which of these are relevant for your typical products?**

---

### **7. VAT on Fees**

#### **Q7.1: VAT Application**
- **Fee Types**: Does VAT apply to all Amazon fees or only specific ones?
- **VAT Rate**: Should we use the same VAT rate (20%) for fees as for products?
- **Calculation Method**: Add VAT to individual fees or total fee amount?

#### **Q7.2: Geographic Considerations**
- **France Specific**: Are there France-specific VAT rules for marketplace fees?
- **B2B vs B2C**: Any different VAT treatment for business vs consumer sales?

---

### **8. User Interface & Configuration**

#### **Q8.1: Configuration Options**
- **GUI Integration**: Should new fees be configurable in the settings dialog?
- **Default Values**: What should be the sensible defaults for each fee type?
- **Advanced Mode**: Should there be a "simple" vs "advanced" fee calculation mode?

#### **Q8.2: Results Display**
- **Fee Breakdown**: Should the GUI show detailed breakdown of all fees?
- **Summary View**: Or just show total fees with option to see details?
- **Comparison**: Show difference between simple and comprehensive calculations?

---

### **9. Data Sources & Accuracy**

#### **Q9.1: Fee Rate Updates**
- **Current Rates**: Are the Amazon France fee rates I mentioned accurate?
- **Update Frequency**: How often do these rates change?
- **Data Source**: Should we reference official Amazon fee schedules?

#### **Q9.2: Real-World Validation**
- **Your Experience**: Based on your actual Amazon selling, which fees are most significant?
- **Category Differences**: Do fee structures vary significantly by product category?
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Are there predictable seasonal variations beyond storage fees?

**Please rank these fees by importance for profitability analysis:**
1. Storage Fee
2. Prep Fee  
3. Inbound Shipping
4. Digital Services Fee
5. Misc Fees
6. VAT on Fees

#### **Q10.2: Implementation Priority**
