    QOGITA API RATE LIMITING - DETAILED EXPLANATION
    =============================================
    
    üö® WHAT HAPPENED:
    When we tested our application multiple times, we received this error:
    "Request was throttled. Expected available in 713 seconds."
    
    üìä THE NUMBERS:
    - 713 seconds = 11 minutes and 53 seconds ‚âà 12 minutes
    - This is quite aggressive rate limiting for an API
    
    üîç WHY THIS HAPPENS:
    
    1. **API Protection**: Qogita protects their servers from being overwhelmed
    2. **Resource Management**: The catalog download endpoint returns large datasets
       - In our test: 1931 L'Or√©al products in a single request
       - This is computationally expensive for their servers
    3. **Fair Usage**: Prevents any single user from monopolizing the API
    
    üì° WHAT TRIGGERS THE RATE LIMIT:
    
    1. **Frequency**: Too many requests in a short time period
       - We made several test requests in rapid succession
       - Likely triggered after 2-3 requests within a few minutes
    
    2. **Endpoint Type**: The /variants/search/download/ endpoint is "heavy"
       - Returns complete product catalogs
       - Much more expensive than simple product lookups
    
    3. **Data Volume**: Large responses consume more server resources
       - 1931 products = significant CSV data to generate
    
    üîß HOW OUR APPLICATION HANDLES IT:
    
    1. **Detection**: We parse the HTTP 429 status code
       ```python
       if response.status_code == 429:
           # Rate limited - extract retry time
           retry_after = parse_retry_time(response)
           raise QogitaRateLimitError(message, retry_after)
       ```
    
    2. **Information Extraction**: We extract the retry time from the error message
       - "Expected available in 713 seconds" ‚Üí retry_after = 713
    
    3. **Graceful Handling**: We don't crash, we inform the user
       - Clear error messages in the UI
       - Proper exception handling in background threads
    
    4. **Logging**: We log the rate limit for debugging
       ```
       ERROR:core.qogita_api:Rate limited while searching brand 'L'Or√©al': 
       Request was throttled. Expected available in 713 seconds.
       ```
    
    üí° RATE LIMITING STRATEGIES:
    
    1. **Built-in Delays**: Our code includes minimum request intervals
       ```python
       self.min_request_interval = 1.0  # 1 second between requests
       ```
    
    2. **Exponential Backoff**: For production use, we could implement:
       - First retry: wait 1 minute
       - Second retry: wait 2 minutes  
       - Third retry: wait 4 minutes
       - etc.
    
    3. **Smart Caching**: Cache results to avoid repeat requests
       - Store brand catalogs locally
       - Only refresh when needed
    
    4. **Batch Processing**: Group multiple brands into single requests when possible
    
    üìà RATE LIMIT PATTERNS (Estimated):
    
    Based on our experience:
    - **Light Usage**: 1-2 requests per minute = OK
    - **Medium Usage**: 3-5 requests per minute = Warning zone
    - **Heavy Usage**: 6+ requests per minute = Rate limited
    - **Recovery Time**: ~12 minutes per violation
    
    üéØ PRODUCTION STRATEGIES:
    
    1. **User Education**: 
       - Warn users about rate limits
       - Suggest optimal usage patterns
    
    2. **Queue Management**:
       - Queue multiple brand requests
       - Process them with appropriate delays
    
    3. **Progress Indication**:
       - Show estimated completion times
       - Allow users to cancel long operations
    
    4. **Smart Scheduling**:
       - Process during off-peak hours
       - Spread requests across time
    
    üîÑ RECOVERY PROCESS:
    
    When rate limited:
    1. **Wait**: Respect the retry_after time (713 seconds = 12 minutes)
    2. **Inform**: Tell user exactly how long to wait
    3. **Queue**: Save the request to retry later
    4. **Resume**: Automatically continue when time expires
    
    ‚úÖ OUR IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
    
    ‚úÖ Rate limit detection working
    ‚úÖ Error parsing working  
    ‚úÖ Graceful error handling
    ‚úÖ User notification system
    ‚úÖ Logging for debugging
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Auto-retry not yet implemented (could be added)
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Caching not yet implemented (could be added)
    
    üìä REAL-WORLD IMPACT:
    
    For typical usage:
    - **Single brand scan**: Works fine, just need to wait between different brands
    - **Multiple brands**: Need to space them out (12+ minutes apart)
    - **Daily operations**: Plan brand scans throughout the day
    - **Bulk analysis**: Best done overnight or during off-peak hours
    
    üíº BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:
    
    This is actually NORMAL for wholesale APIs:
    - Protects against abuse
    - Ensures fair access for all users
    - Maintains system stability
    - Forces thoughtful usage patterns
    
    üîß RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
    
    1. **Plan Ahead**: Choose 3-5 key brands to analyze daily
    2. **Schedule**: Space brand scans 15-20 minutes apart
    3. **Cache**: Save results locally to avoid re-requesting
    4. **Optimize**: Focus on high-value brands first
    
    This rate limiting is typical for B2B APIs and shows that Qogita
    takes their system stability seriously!
